                <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
                <p>
                    Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible
                    DOM's, broken support, and abandoned browsers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless
                    efforts of folk like theW3C, WaSP, and the major browser creators.
                </p>

                <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
                <p>
                    There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The
                    Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing
                    designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The
                    HTML remains the same, the only thing that has changed
                    is the external CSSfile. Yes, really.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a
                    hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by
                    demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create
                    beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can
                    always push it further.

                <p>
                    Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong
                    CSS skills are necessary too, but the example files are
                    commented well enough that evenCSS novices can use them
                    as starting points. Please see the <a href="/examples.css">CSS</a>
                    Resource Guide</a> for advanced tutorials and tips on working with CSS.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This may seem daunting at
                    first if you've
                    never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as
                    a guide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Download the sample <a href="/examples.html">HTML</a> and <a href="/examples.css">CSS</a> towork on
                    a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don't submit
                    half-finished work) upload your CSS file to a web server
                    under your control. <a href="/sendUsLink.examples">Send us a link</a> to an archive of that
                    file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our
                    server.

                <h3>Requirements</h3>
                <p>
                    Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be limited to
                    widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be
                    provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical CSSn and not the latest bleeding-edge
                    tricks viewable by 2%
                    of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your CSS validates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented CSS by now. When
                    sticking to the guidelines you should see
                    fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the
                    web these days and especially when you factor in mobile and pixel-perfect layouts may not be
                    possible across every platform. That's okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design
                    should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over
                    90% of the population).
                </p>

                    We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable
                    material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work.
                    We're well past the point of needing another garden-related design.
